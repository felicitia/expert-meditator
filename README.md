# Expert Meditator Dataset Collection

This is a passion project born out of the love for meditation and everything. 🧘‍♀️💖 Everyone is more than welcome (and encouraged! 🙏) to contribute if you come across any **Public Datasets on Expert Meditators** (yes, they exist! Not all of them are hidding in the mountains :) 🏔️).

## Why

As meditation becomes more and more popular all around the world, it's profound impact on humanity is simply too good to pass. Many leading scientists are studying *it*, but VERY LITTLE data is available in public on **Expert Meditators**. These precious data not only have the potential to improve well-being, unlock human potential, but can also lead to breakthroughs in understanding reality and conciousness. In fact, it is already happening!! 🔥 For starters, you can check out Harvard's [Meditation Research Program](https://meditation.mgh.harvard.edu/).

That's why we can come together to fill this gap! 🤗 For example, I already know some Expert Meditators are willing to record their own data at home and are more than happy to share with whoever has the skills to analyze it. At the same time, we also know many researchers are earger to get their hands on Expert Meditators' data but don't know where to find them. Kudos to all those people! 👏

So there you go! Living in a connected world where everything is possible, why don't we tap into the magic of Internet to fulfill both sides' wonderful wishes? 🪄 

## What

This repository is a place to collect **Public Datasets on Expert Meditators**. We only maintain a [Table of Content](datasets.md) of different datasets (a collection of links basically), and everyone can send a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to update this magical library of links (hope there will be more coming! ✨).

We hope this simple act can have a ripple effect to serve as a bridge where what you offer meets someone else's needs! 💫

## How
